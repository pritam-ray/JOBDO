## üêõ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **No Results Found**

### **Slow Search**
- **Cause**: Network congestion or API limits
- **Solution**: Built-in timeouts and fallbacks
- **User Action**: Wait for parallel searches to complete

### **Missing Contact Info**

- **Solution**: System merges data from multiple sources
- **Expected**: 60-80% of results have phone/email

### **Duplicate Companies**
- **Cause**: Same company found in multiple sources  
- **Solution**: Advanced deduplication merges information
- **Result**: Single entry with combined contact data
